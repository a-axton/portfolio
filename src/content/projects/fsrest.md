name: Node Filesystem REST API
order: 8
demo: https://github.com/a-axton/fs-rest-api
photo: github.jpg
tech: Node, Express
blurb: An experiment to expose a directory's filesystem to the browser. This is a simple Rest API that will allow you to create, read, delete and edit files. It's locked to a specified directory so that no operations can take place that aren't wanted. It's probably only best to use for development or internal tools.
