blurb: Mobile web app for a lazer maze game. It's a timed game where you try to navigate through a laser field without breaking any. The app acts as a leaderboard for contestants and as an external display showing the contestant's score with live notification when they break a laser. The app allows users to claim their score, add personal info, photos and live tweet their score. Many of the features don't work without the paired Raspberry Pi.
