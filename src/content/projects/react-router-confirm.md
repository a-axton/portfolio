name: React router confirm navigation
order: 8
demo: https://github.com/a-axton/react-router-confirm-navigation
photo: github.jpg
tech: React, Javascript
blurb: A react component to confirm or cancel a react router navigation event. Displays a custom component under a specified condition. Useful for asking a user to confirm leaving a page if there is unsaved work. I built this because react router only has capabilities to display a native alert box and doesn't allow for asnyc operations for the condition.
